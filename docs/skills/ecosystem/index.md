## Integration Patterns

### Quick Setup Example

```python
from webagents.agents import BaseAgent
from webagents.agents.skills.ecosystem.x_com import XComSkill
from webagents.agents.skills.ecosystem.n8n import N8nSkill
from webagents.agents.skills.ecosystem.zapier import ZapierSkill
from webagents.agents.skills.ecosystem.crewai import CrewAISkill
from webagents.agents.skills.ecosystem.database import SupabaseSkill
from webagents.agents.skills.ecosystem.mongodb import MongoDBSkill

# All dependencies are automatically resolved
agent = BaseAgent(
    name="automation-agent",
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    skills={
        "n8n": N8nSkill(),        # Auto-resolves: auth, kv
        "zapier": ZapierSkill(),  # Auto-resolves: auth, kv
        "crewai": CrewAISkill(),  # Auto-resolves: auth, kv
        "database": SupabaseSkill(),  # Auto-resolves: auth, kv
        "mongodb": MongoDBSkill(), # Auto-resolves: auth, kv
        "x_com": XComSkill()      # Auto-resolves: auth, kv, notifications
    }
)
```
