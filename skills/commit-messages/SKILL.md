# Conventional Commit Workflow

## When To Use

- Generating conventional commit messages from staged changes

## When NOT To Use

- Full pull request preparation, beyond the commit message
- Amending existing commits: use git directly

## Steps

1. **Gather context** (run in parallel):
   - `git status -sb`
   - `git diff --cached --stat`
   - `git diff --cached`
   - `git log --oneline -5`

   If nothing is staged, tell the user and stop.

   Name the entities that changed (function, class,
   method) in the subject and body rather than the files:
   "add function validate_webhook_url", not
   "add validation logic to notify.py".

2. **Classify**: Pick type (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`,
   `test`, `chore`, `style`, `perf`, `ci`) and optional scope.

3. **Draft the message**:
   - **Subject**: `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>` (50 chars max)
   - **Body**: What and why, wrapped at 72 chars
   - **Footer**: BREAKING CHANGE or issue refs

4. **Slop check**: reject these words and replace with plain
   alternatives:

   | Reject | Use instead |
   |--------|-------------|
   | leverage, utilize | use |
   | seamless | smooth |
   | comprehensive | complete |
   | robust | solid |
   | facilitate | enable |
   | streamline | simplify |
   | optimize | improve |
   | delve | explore |
   | multifaceted | varied |
   | pivotal | key |
   | intricate | detailed |

   Also reject: "it's worth noting", "at its core",
   "in essence", "a testament to"

5. **Show** the message for review before committing.

## Rules

- NEVER use `git commit --no-verify` or `-n`
- Write for humans, not to impress
- If pre-commit hooks fail, fix the issues
